* Squared loss minimizes expectation. Pick it when learning expected return on a stock.
* Logistic loss minimizes probability. Pick it when learning probability of click on advertisement.
* Hinge loss minimizes the 0,1 / yes-no question. Pick it when you want a hard prediction.
* Quantile loss minimizes the median. Pick it when you want to predict house prices.
